A new Flutter % ML project.

## Getting Started
Presentation link : https://prezi.com/p/edit/fafftkgwpjzp/

Problem Statement : 
Humans in the age range of 25-35 tend to learn things faster than people in the age range of above 4O years. It gets harder to teach old people about new technologies. Our aim is to help teach elderly people using interactive ways, so that they relate to the technology and embrace it instead of seeing something as hostile and alien to them.
